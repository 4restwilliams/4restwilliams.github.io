The 2020 annual conference for the Geological Society of New Zealand was held on the 22nd to 25th, and at this conference I presented some of the work from the first year of my PhD. This presentation details my landslide susceptibilty analysis for large deep-seated landslide in the southern North Island of New Zealand and is entitled: "Susceptibility Factors Controlling the Occurrence of Slow-Moving Large Landslides in the Whanganui Basin Sediments, North Island". Overall this research showed that river incision is key factor controlling the failure rates of these landslides. You can view my presentation at the link below.
