title: About me
---

While I grew up in Michigan, I have lived throughout the Midwestern United States and recently moved to New Zealand to pursue a PhD in Earth Science. I have a B.A. in Geology from Carleton College, a M.S. in Environmental Science from Iowa State University, and will graduated with a PhD in Earth Sciences from massey in July 2021.

My research has focused tracking the sediment contributions of various erosional sources (e.g.river banks and landslides) at regional scales. Recently, my first paper [Automated measurement of eroding streambank volume from high-resolution aerial imagery and terrain analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.107313) was recently published in the Geomorphology.

Currently, I am focused on assessing the activity of slow-moving landslides across New Zealand using Interferometric Synthetic Apertue Radar [(InSAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) so that their sediment contributions can be taken into account.
