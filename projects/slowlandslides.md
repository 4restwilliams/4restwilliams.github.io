New Zealand has many large slow-moving landslides that could contribute large amounts of sediment to rivers, but little is known about the movement patterns of these landslide and few are actively monitored. The resources needed to conduct in-field monitoring of these landslides would be astronomical, but I believe that interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and other remote sensing techniques can be used to monitor these features effectively. In my PhD I hope to reach a better understanding of the that factors that cause these features occur and to determine which landslides are contributing the most sediment to local rivers.
